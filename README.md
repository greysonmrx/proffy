## :recycle: About the project
This project was developed on the Next Level Week event by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) &nbsp;ðŸš€&nbsp;ðŸ’œ

With the idea of connecting students and teachers, this software provides a flow to register teachers and their classes, defining the times that will be available. Students will be able to search for teachers by a specific subject, the day of the week or the time when teachers will be available. In the end, the classes could get in touch with the chosen teachers via Whatsapp and create a new connection.

## :rocket: Features

- **React Native** â€” A lib that provides a way to create native apps for Android and iOS
- **Express** â€” A web framework for Node
